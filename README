Code to send a byte from 0 - 255 from each potentiometer to control a motor on the boat, one for a sail and one for a winch; The receive code reads serial data from the Xbee, and decodes it using. Hamming(7,4). However, I realize I need the value to not be mapped from 0-255 but to act as 0 when the value is half (128) because it will be controlled by a pot that is spring loaded to return to the center, at which point the motor should not move. Then I will have to switch the DIR pin from high to low to reverse the motors direction, and increase in speed incrementally as it approaches the pot goes from 128 to 255 and vice versa, from 128 to 0 the other way.
